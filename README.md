# word-encryptor

This is my first solo project, and I decided to create it to apply a couple of concepts that I saw at college.

The encrypting key adds or subtracts to the index of each letter of the typed word until it reaches the correct encrypted/decrypted one, and after going through each letter, in the end of the loops, a word is formed.

I am 100% certain that this code has many different ways to be optimized, but it is something I developed by myself for the first time and wanted to share it with the world.

As I continue my studies, I will be updating this project to keep track of how much I have improved overtime. I look forward to seeing myself laughing at this code because of how bad and poorly optimized it is.
